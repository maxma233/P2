## Project Description

Write and fully demonstrate a Scheme function that implements a duplication operation. Your function should be named super-duper, and have this interface:(super-duper source count)

## General Reflection 

This is new programming language for me, personally I found this assignment quite challenge, but it's interesting one for sure,  there's still uncertainty when I run the code, for some reason I couldn't pass test which require pass any input values. Overall, it's good experience.
