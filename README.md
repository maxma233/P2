# Programming Language Assignment 2: JavaScript

* Author: Max Ma

## Project Description

The Store class represents a ‘store’ of information, and contains a HashMap and two methods, addToStore and toString. 
The Parser class contains a Store object, and implements a method that reads a JSON dataset and recursively searches it for a specific tag.



## Project semester and year

Fall Semester, 2023

## Running the program

    node driver.js <path to JSON data file> <tag to search for>

## General Reflection 

In this programming project, I learned about Port an existing Java program to Javascript and
Implement a recursive procedure to traverse JSON. Difficult part is how to read the file from 
JSON data and the parse function recursively traverse the element in the array. But overall it's 
great programming project.
